pychebfun - Python Chebyshev Functions
======================================

About
-----

The Chebfun system is designed to perform fast and accurate functional
computations. The system incorporates the use of Chebyshev polynomial
expansions, Lagrange interpolation with the barycentric formula, and
Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature to perform fast functional evaluation, integration,
root-finding, and other operations.

The pychebfun project is based on the mathematical work of Battles and
Trefethen et. al. yet is optimized to take advantage of the tools in the
Numpy/Scipy and Sage libraries. This project is solely for the educational
purposes of the owner and is not meant to compete with the Matlab library
created by Battles and Trefethen. Any questions regarding the Chebfun package
for Matlab should be directed towards the Chebfun team:
